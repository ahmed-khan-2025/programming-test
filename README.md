# Bingo Game – Find the Last Winning Board
This project includes two implementations (Node.js and Python) of a Bingo game solver that:

- Reads bingo draw numbers and boards from an input file (`input.txt`)
- Simulates a game where numbers are drawn

- Calculates the final score as the sum of unmarked numbers multiplied by the winning
